A <code>Candidate</code> needs to fulfill two requirements. First, it needs to be a Service as defined above. And second, it needs to target the area of Research Data Management in the Energy Domain. </p> <p>The goal for every Candidate Service is to become a full <code>NFDI4Energy Service</code>. Therefore, a few more requirements have to be met.</p> <ul> <li>A clear legal status for all relevant aspects are needed. First, a Terms of Service needs to clarify how the service can be used. Second, if the service produces or provides data of some kind, it needs to be clarified how this data can be used. And third, if the codebase of the service is open-source, it needs to have a license attached.</li> <li>The service needs to be in operation - it needs to be more than a prototype. We think that a Technology Readiness Level of 7 or above is required.</li> <li>The service needs to be documented. It is great if tutorials are provided within the <code>Best Practice</code> module of NFDI4Energy. If the underlying code of the service is open-source, this code also needs a documentation.</li> <li>A support needs to be available for users. This means, that there is at least an email adress available for users seeking support.</li> <li>The service needs to be interoperable with relevant other services and relevant standards. The specific meaning of this is to be decided case by case. The developers and stakeholders from NFDI4Energy will define all relevant standards and other services that are relevant. </li> </ul> You think a requirement is missing here? <p>Discuss requirements with us, either via mail service[@]nfdi4energy.org or in the github issue.</p> <pre><code>%%{init: {\"flowchart\": {\"htmlLabels\": false}} {\"theme\":\"dark\" }}%%\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Candidate\n        direction LR\n        can1[\"Can be used in Research Data Management in the Energy Domain\"]\n        can2[\"Wants to become an NFDI4Energy Service\"]\n    end\n    subgraph NFDI4Energy-Service\n        direction LR\n        ser1[Clear legal status regarding usage of the service, the produced results, and the underlying codebase] \n        ser2[\"Service is in Operation: TRL 7-9\"] \n        ser3[Documentation Pages exist for the service]\n        ser4[Contact details for support exist] \n        ser5[Interoperability with other Services and NFDI4Energy Standards]\n        click ser2 \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level\" \"Wikipedia Article of TRLs\"\n    end  \n    Candidate --&gt; NFDI4Energy-Service</code></pre>"},{"location":"about/#how-are-services-categorized","title":"How are services categorized?","text":""},{"location":"about/#categorization-based-on-the-data-life-cycle","title":"Categorization based on the <code>Data Life Cycle</code>","text":"<p>Data Services are tools that help researchers in one or multiple steps of the Research Data Management Life Cycle.
