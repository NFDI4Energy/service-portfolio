# NFDI4Energy Best Practices Service
We make energy system research knowledge accessible in a central point.

The content can take form of Tutorials, Use Cases, or Examplary implementations. It can be provided in different formats, such as video or text. The goal is to disseminate knowledge that might not be recorded
in papers, e.g., problems, implementation details.
