# About

## What is a service?
Closely alligned with the Base4NFDI defintion, we define a service as follows:

!!! note "Definition"

    A service is a technical-oganisational solution that typically offers

    * ☁️ storage and computing services
    * 🔁 software, processes and workflows
    * ☎️ support for service desk

    ... with different levels of technicity.
    

## What are the Requirements for becoming an NFDI4Energy Service?
This site collects data services that are relevant in the energy domain. To appear in this Collection, the following criteria are used:

* The Service targets the german energy sector.
* The Service targets one or multiple steps in the `Data Life Cycle`.
* The Service already complies with the FAIR criteria or it is aiming to do so in the future.

## How are services categorized?

### Categorization based on the `Data Life Cycle`

Data Services are tools that help researchers in one or multiple steps of the Research Data Management Life Cycle. Hence, services can get one or multiple of the tags [planning](categories.md/#dlcplanning), [production](categories.md/#dlcproduction), [analysis](categories.md/#dlcanalysis), [storage](categories.md/#dlcstorage), [access](categories.md/#dlcaccess), and [re-use](categories.md/#dlcre-use).

### Categorization based on the DFG Definitions
These categories are relevant for the DFG reporting. They can be accessed from the nfdi1000 Excel sheet [here](https://www.dfg.de/de/foerderung/foerderinitiativen/nfdi/formulare-merkblaetter) and the [Guide](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-initiative/nfdi/guide-to-filling-out-the-supplementary-data-sheet-for-consortia-of-the-national-research-data-infrastructure-nfdi-)

First, Categories are defined based on the [de.NBI](https://zenodo.org/records/6597826) definitions (see Drop Down Categories from the reporting excel sheet, Tab 5)

| Category             | Definition                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Database             | software providing large amounts of structured data to the user. Usually the data can be uploaded, accessed, searched and/or downloaded via a web browser. |
| Library / API        | collection of pre‐implemented functions for a specific task that can be accessed via a well‐ defined interfaces.                                           |
| Workflow             | software that combines multiple tools / applications. They may be used locally or remotely via the internet.                                               |
| Tools / applications | software that can be downloaded and executed locally on the users' hardware.                                                                               |
| Web applications     | software that is installed on a server and can be used by users via a web page and the internet.                                                           |
| Storage              | Not defined by de.NBI                                                                                                                                      |
| Data Curation        | Not defined by de.NBI                                                                                                                                      |

de.NBI additionally defines `Support / consulting` as "service with direct user contact for topics going beyond the support for the other services".

### Categorization based on the DFG Service Descriptions
The DFG Reporting asks for the state of the software. We map these states to TLR levels, where we follow the [Criteria for Basic Services](https://base4nfdi.de/process/criteria-for-basic-services) from base4nfdi.

| DFG Service Description | Technology Readiness Level TLR |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Development             | 1-4                            |
| Prototype               | 5-6                            |
| Operation               | 7-9                            |
| Terminated              |                                |

Is the software open-source? If yes, add the tag

* open-source
